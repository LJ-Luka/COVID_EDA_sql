# COVID Exploratory Data Analysis

**SUMMARY**  
This SQL exploratory data analysis project involved using COVID data to perform intermediate and advanced SQL operations. Some of the intermediate and advanced SQL skills that have been used in this project include using GROUP BY to group rows based on one or more columns, ORDER BY to sort the result set in ascending or descending order, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX and MIN to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value, Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to create a temporary result set that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement, Temporary Tables to store and process intermediate results, JOINS to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them, INSERT INTO to insert new records into a table and CREATE VIEW to create a virtual table based on the result set of a SELECT statement.  
These allowed for more complex data manipulation and analysis, providing deeper insights into the COVID data.

**Covid Data**
